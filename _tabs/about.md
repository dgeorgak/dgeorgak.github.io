## Welcome to my blog!

### `$whoami`
I'm Dim.  Your average nature lover, ambience appreciator, husband, traveller, cat parent, security engineer, and pentesting, OSINT, cyber threat intelligence enthusiast.  
I am all of the above and a few more, not necessarily in the aforementioned order or priority.

### `$cat /what/is/this/place`
This is where I am putting together a collection of pieces based on the notes I have kept over the years while learning about cybersecurity.
On top of that, this is also an assortment of tool guides, quick wins, CTF writeups, thoughts, ideas, experiments, and anything else that might come into mind in the long run, directly or indirectly related to cybersecurity.

### `$less why.txt`
"why" as in why share my notes?  
My notes have helped me over the years to learn and grow.  Maybe they will help you as well.

"why" as in why make posts out of them?
Trust me.  You do not want to bother going through my notes.  And even if you did I do not think that you would gain much by reading them.  
My notes are helpful for me because I wrote them in a way that makes sense to me.  I encourage you to do the same for yours.

### `$man thisPage`
Any tool guides that you find in this page can either be very simple and surface level, or detailed and more elaborate.  That all depends on whether my intention is to help you kickstart your processes without drowning you in a plethora of information, or provide a deep dive on the capabilities of each tool.  

No matter what the case is, my advice is always the same: **RTFM**!  
Jokes aside, please consider this statement as applicable to all of my posts.  Using a tool while going through its man pages, its documentation, or googling about it, will provide you with much more knowledge than any single post or writeup will.

All thoughts, opinions and ideas shared in this page are my own, and I expect that they are treated as such.  I welcome feedback, different perspectives and conversations around them.  So if you feel like it, lets chat.  But kindly remember to keep it constructive, without bringing any bad vibes along with it.

All information posted in this page are for educational purposes only.  You want to put into practice something that I have posted?  By all means do.  There are platforms that you can use to ethically and legally practice all of this, and I encourage you to do so.  
There is a simple but important difference between being and not being an ethical hacker, and that is having the explicit permission to act on a target by their rightful owner.  
Do not use this knowledge for illegal and/or unethical purposes.  I carry no responsibility if you decide to do so.
